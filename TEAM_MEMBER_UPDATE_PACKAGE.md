# Team Member Update Package

## 🚨 **Critical Updates Required**

Your team member MUST update these files to get the agent coordination working properly.

---

## 📁 **Files to Copy From Zach's System**

### **CRITICAL - Must Replace:**
1. **`integrated_agent_coordination.py`** ⚠️ **MUST UPDATE**
   - Contains all bug fixes for counter-proposals  
   - Fixed enum parsing that was breaking auto-responses
   - Added missing message handlers
   
### **Required Supporting Files:**
2. **`agent_email_monitor.py`** - Email monitoring system
3. **`coordination_helpers.py`** - Easy-to-use functions
4. **`agent_config.py`** - Configuration management

### **Setup Instructions:**
6. **`TEAM_MEMBER_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide
7. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Updated with coordination info

---

## 💾 **How to Share**

### **Option 1: Copy Individual Files** (Recommended)
```bash
# Team member copies these specific files:
cp integrated_agent_coordination.py [their-project]/
cp agent_email_monitor.py [their-project]/
cp coordination_helpers.py [their-project]/
cp agent_config.py [their-project]/
cp TEAM_MEMBER_SETUP.md [their-project]/
```

### **Option 2: Share Entire Clean Project**
- Give them the whole `/google-calendar-scheduler/` folder
- They need to replace their `credentials.json` and `token.json` with their own
- They lose any custom modifications they made

---

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions for Team Member**

After they update the files:

1. **Test Basic Setup:**
```python
from coordination_helpers import setup_coordination_for_user
setup_coordination_for_user("Team Member Name", "their@email.com")
```

2. **Test Sending to You:**
```python
from coordination_helpers import schedule_meeting_with_agent
result = schedule_meeting_with_agent(
    target_email="zach@empire.email", 
    meeting_subject="Test Coordination",
    duration_minutes=30
)
print("Request sent:", result['coordination_initiated'])
```

3. **You Start Monitoring:**
```bash
python3 agent_email_monitor.py monitor 60
```

4. **Verify Full Workflow:**
   - They send request → You receive and auto-respond with proposal
   - They receive proposal → Their agent confirms or counter-proposes  
   - Negotiation continues until meeting confirmed
   - Calendar events created on both sides

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

System is working when:
- ✅ **Messages send successfully** between agents
- ✅ **Auto-responses work** (no more enum errors)
- ✅ **Counter-proposals handled** (back-and-forth negotiation)  
- ✅ **Calendar events created** when confirmed
- ✅ **Both agents can initiate** coordination

---

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**

The updated `integrated_agent_coordination.py` includes:
- ✅ **Counter-proposal handler** (was completely missing)
- ✅ **Rejection handler** (was missing)
- ✅ **Enum parsing fix** (auto-responses were failing)
- ✅ **Calendar error handling** (graceful degradation)
- ✅ **Negotiation limits** (prevents infinite back-and-forth)

**Without these fixes, agent coordination will not work properly!**
