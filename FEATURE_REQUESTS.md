# Feature Requests & Roadmap

This document tracks planned features, feature requests from team members, and the development roadmap for the Google Calendar Scheduler project.

## üöÄ Current Development Roadmap

The following features are planned for implementation in priority order:

### 1. Agent negotiations happen in natural language
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Enable agents to negotiate meeting times using natural language processing instead of rigid structured formats, making the coordination process more human-like and flexible.

### 2. Agent conversations happen in reply threads, not new emails
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Improve email organization by keeping all agent coordination within reply threads rather than creating new email chains, reducing inbox clutter and maintaining conversation context.

### 3. Emails are automatically archived only once a meeting has been confirmed and scheduled
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Implement intelligent email archiving that only moves coordination emails to archive after successful meeting confirmation, ensuring important negotiations remain visible until resolved.

### 4. Meeting Invites in calendar contain more specific and relevant titles, and more context in the note including links to relevant docs
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Enhance calendar event creation with intelligent title generation and rich context including relevant document links, participant context, and meeting purpose details.

### 5. Implement the ability for users to define quantitative time preferences
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Allow users to set specific time preferences such as "prefer meetings between 10 AM - 4 PM" or "avoid meetings on Fridays after 3 PM" with quantifiable constraints.

### 6. Implement the ability for users to define qualitative time preferences, including referencing other Google apps like docs or tasks
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Enable users to set context-aware preferences like "avoid scheduling during focused work time as defined in Google Tasks" or "prefer meetings when specific Google Docs are due for review."

### 7. Connect additional personal context docs
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Integrate with additional personal documents and data sources to provide richer context for meeting scheduling and coordination decisions.

### 8. [PLACEHOLDER] Define additional more general "familiar" functionality
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Research and implement additional features that make the system feel more familiar and intuitive to users, based on common calendar and scheduling patterns.
